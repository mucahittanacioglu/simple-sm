Here I tried to simulate simple social media.I have used near-starter-sdk project as template.
You can create topic and people can comment on that.
I used PersistentVector for storing topics and comments.
Each topic has its comment array and there is one global topic array.
I used context from nearSDK for attached deposit and for id of commenter.
